      # Examples
    </p>
    <p>
      You can generate a position from an example script. In the list, there also icons in order to know if we can hope for a win or for a draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you can clone an example and adapt it for your own needs. And you can also see the code of an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      # Custom scripts
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also define your custom scripts : each section is written in a subset of the Lua language. There&apos;s also a manual in the script editor page.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also see the predefined variables of each script section, as well as their types. And you can insert them in your code by selecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      # Game
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the position is generated, you can play it against the computer, and abort it at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever game is finished, you can see the history of moves.
